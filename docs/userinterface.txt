Goal:
The goal of the Userinterface component is to handle all command-line interaction for the TopSecret program.
No other class in the program reads from or interprets command-line arguments directly.

Assumptions:
The program is executed from the project root directory.
The program is launched using the java topsecret command.
Any data files and key files referenced by the user exist unless an error is reported.

Responsibilities:
- Parse command-line arguments provided by the user.
- Display a list of available files when no arguments are supplied.
- Validate that file identifiers are correctly formatted as two-digit numbers.
- Accept an optional key file path for deciphering.
- Delegate all program execution logic to the ProgramControl component.
- Display usage information and error messages when invalid input is detected.

Design:
Other components do not interact with the command line.
The Userinterface component interprets user input and invokes ProgramControl to perform all application logic.
ProgramControl is provided to Userinterface through constructor injection to support isolation and unit testing.

Error Handling:

- If an invalid number of arguments is provided, usage information is displayed.
- If a file number is not exactly two digits, the input is rejected.
- If required arguments are missing, an error message and usage information are displayed.
- Errors returned from ProgramControl are printed to the user.

Testing Plan:
Unit tests verify that valid command-line arguments are accepted and correctly forwarded to ProgramControl, and that invalid arguments result in appropriate error messages and usage output.
ProgramControl is mocked during testing to isolate Userinterface behavior.
