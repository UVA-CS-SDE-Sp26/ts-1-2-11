TopSecret - User Interface (CLI)

Purpose:
This document describes the command-line options for the TopSecret program and the expected behavior.

Usage:
  java topsecret [number] [optional_key_path]

Options:
  (no arguments)
    - Lists available files. Files are shown with a two-digit index (01, 02, ...)

  [number]
    - Two-digit file number to display (example: 01).
    - Uses the default key file (ciphers/key.txt or key.txt depending on program configuration).

  [number] [optional_key_path]
    - Two-digit file number to display and a path to a key file to use for deciphering.

Examples:
  java topsecret
    Lists files stored by the program.

  java topsecret 01
    Display file 01 using the default key.

  java topsecret 01 ciphers/key.txt
    Display file 01 using the provided key file at ciphers/key.txt.

Behavior & Errors:
  - File numbers must be two digits (regex: "\\d{2}").
    If an invalid number is provided, the program prints an error and shows usage.
  - If the key file path is missing or blank when required, the program prints an error and shows usage.
  - On other errors (file-not-found, decrypt errors), the program prints the error message and usage.

Notes for Developers / Testers:
  - The `Userinterface` class accepts a `ProgramControl` instance via constructor injection. For unit tests, mock `ProgramControl` to return file lists and file content. Mockito or similar mocking frameworks make this straightforward.
  - Helper methods to validate and print usage are located in `Userinterface.java`.
