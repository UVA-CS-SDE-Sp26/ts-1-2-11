Team Member C – ProgramControl Plan + Testing Plan

Responsibilities:
- Connect the command-line args to FileHandler (list/read) and CipherService (decipher).
- ProgramControl must never access the filesystem directly.

Behaviors:
- No args: list available .txt files from FileHandler, numbered 01, 02, ...
- One arg (N): read the Nth file and display its contents (deciphered if needed).
- Two args (N keyPath): same as above, but pass keyPath to CipherService.
- Exit after listing, showing contents, or printing an error message.

Error handling:
- Non-numeric file number: print a clear error.
- Out of range file number: print a clear error.
- File read fails: print a clear error.
- Decipher fails: print a clear error.

TDD Unit Tests:
- Use fake FileHandler (no filesystem) to test ProgramControl deterministically.
- Test listing: sorted + 2-digit numbering.
- Test selecting file: correct mapping from number -> filename.
- Test default key path vs override key path is passed to CipherService.
- Test invalid number/out-of-range returns correct error and does not read.
- Test read failure returns graceful error.
- Test decipher failure returns graceful error.
