Goal:
The goal of the Cipher component is to convert (decipher) ciphered mission text
into readable plain text.

Key File Location & Format:
- Cipher keys are stored in a folder named "ciphers" in the project root.
- The default key filename is "key.txt".
- A key file contains 2 lines:
  Line 1: actual/plain character set (what each cipher char should become)
  Line 2: cipher character set (what appears in the file)

Example:
Line 1 (actual): abcdef
Line 2 (cipher): bcdefa

This means cipher 'b' decodes to actual 'a', cipher 'c' decodes to 'b', etc.

Validation Rules:
When a cipher key is loaded it must be validated to ensure deciphering is
unambiguous:
- Must have at least 2 lines.
- Line 1 and Line 2 must be the same length.
- Neither line may be empty.
- No duplicates allowed within Line 1.
- No duplicates allowed within Line 2.

Deciphering Behavior:
- Each character in the ciphered text is checked against the cipher mapping.
- If the character exists in the mapping, it is replaced with the corresponding
  "actual" character.
- If the character is not present in the mapping (e.g., whitespace, punctuation),
  it is left unchanged.

Interfaces / Integration Points:
- Cipher.loadKey(keyPath) loads and validates a key file and returns a CipherKey.
- Cipher.decipher(cipheredText, keyPath) returns a fully deciphered String.
- If the key file path is provided as just "key.txt", the implementation attempts
  to load it from "./ciphers/key.txt" if a direct path does not exist.

Testing Plan (Unit Tests):
- Load a valid key file -> mapping is correct.
- Decipher a known string -> output matches expectation.
- Missing key file -> IOException thrown.
- Malformed key file cases -> IllegalArgumentException thrown:
  - fewer than 2 lines
  - empty lines
  - length mismatch
  - duplicate characters (either line)
