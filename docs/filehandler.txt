Goal:
The goal of the FileHandler component is to centralize all direct access to files.
No other class in the program reads from or interacts with the filesystem directly.

Assumptions:
The program is executed from the project root directory.
A folder named "data" already exists in the working directory and contains all
text files that may be read by the program.

Responsibilities:
- Locate the existing data directory in the working directory.
- Provide a list of available .txt files stored in the data folder.
- Read and return the contents of a requested file as text.
- Validate filenames to prevent invalid or unsafe file access.

Design:
Other components request file information through the FileHandler interface.
FileHandler handles all file reading and returns results or throws errors when
files cannot be found or accessed.

Error Handling:
- If the data directory does not exist, the program fails immediately.
- If a requested file does not exist, an error is returned to the caller.
- Invalid filenames are rejected.

Testing Plan:
Unit tests verify that files can be listed from data directory, file contents can be read correctly,
and appropriate errors are thrown for missing or invalid files.
